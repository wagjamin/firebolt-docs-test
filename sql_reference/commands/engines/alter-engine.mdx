Modify the configuration of an existing Firebolt engine. 

## ALTER ENGINE SET

Updates the configuration of the specified engine.

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER ENGINE <engine_name> SET
    [AUTO_START = <true/false>]
    [AUTO_STOP = <minutes>]
    [DEFAULT_DATABASE = <database_name>]
    [MIN_CLUSTERS = <clusters>]
    [MAX_CLUSTERS = <clusters>]
    [NODES = <nodes>]
    [TYPE = <type>]
    [FAMILY = <family>]
```

### Options 
  

| Parameter                            | Description                                  |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `<engine_name>`                      | The name of the engine to be altered.        |
| `AUTO_START = <true/false>`          | When set to `TRUE`, sending a query to a stopped engine will automatically start the engine before processing the query. |
| `AUTO_STOP = <minutes>`              | Specifies the number of minutes after which an engine automatically stops. Setting `minutes` to `0` disables `AUTO_STOP`. |
| `AUTO_VACUUM = <on/off>`             | When `on`, the engine will automatically assess the health of tablesâ€™ data layout after processing a DML operation, and will run the `VACUUM` command when necessary to maintain the underlying table health. |
| `DEFAULT_DATABASE = <database_name>` | Specifies the default database that an engine will attempt to use when processing queries that require a database. To remove the default database, set `DEFAULT_DATABASE=default`. |
| `CLUSTERS = <clusters>` (deprecated) | Specifies the number of clusters in an engine. Each cluster is a group of nodes, and all clusters within an engine are identical in terms of node type and number of nodes. |
| `MIN_CLUSTERS = <clusters>`          | Specifies a minimum number of clusters in an engine. If `MIN_CLUSTERS` is different from `MAX_CLUSTERS`, the engine will automatically change the number of clusters depending on load. If not specified, `1` is used as default. |
| `MAX_CLUSTERS = <clusters>`          | Specifies a maximum number of clusters in an engine. If `MIN_CLUSTERS` is different from `MAX_CLUSTERS`, the engine will automatically change the number of clusters depending on load. If not specified, `1` is used as default. |
| `NODES = <nodes>`                    | Specifies the number of nodes in each cluster within an engine. You can specify any integer between `1` to `128`, inclusive. |
| `TYPE =<type>`                       | Specifies the node type for the engine. You can choose `S`, `M`, `L`, or `XL`. |
| `FAMILY =<family>`                   | Defines the family of node used in the engine. Options include `STORAGE_OPTIMIZED` (alias `SO`) or `COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED` (alias `CO`). |

**Limitations:**
* Each engine is limited to a maximum of two clusters.
* Each cluster can have up to ten nodes. 
* The total number of nodes across all clusters cannot exceed 15.
* When scaling a running engine either vertically or horizontally, new queries will be directed to the new cluster. Queries running on the original clusters will continue until completion. The clusters will wait up to 24 hours for these queries to finish, after which any unfinished queries may be stopped.
* Only small and medium engines are available for use right away.

If you would like to remove the following limitations, reach out to Firebolt support at [support@firebolt.io](mailto:support@firebolt.io) to do the following:

*  Use a large or extra-large engine.
*  Use more than ten nodes per cluster.
*  Use more than 15 nodes across all clusters.

## Examples

### Scale out an engine      
The following code example scales out, or increases the number of nodes, in an engine by setting the engine's `NODES` to `3`: 

```sql
ALTER ENGINE my_engine SET NODES = 3;
```

### Scale up an engine       
The following code example scales up an engine by increasing its capacity from small (`S`) to large (`L`) by setting the engine's `TYPE` parameter to `L`: 

```sql
ALTER ENGINE my_engine SET TYPE = "L";
```

### Change Family
The following code example changes engine's family type to compute-optimized by setting the engine's `FAMILY` parameter to `CO`:

```sql
ALTER ENGINE my_engine SET FAMILY = "CO";
```

### Scale up and out an engine     
The following code example both scales up and scales out an engine by increasing node capacity and the number of nodes: 

```sql
ALTER ENGINE my_engine SET TYPE = "L" NODES = 5;
```

<Note>
If you need to use a large or extra-large engine, reach out to [support@firebolt.io](mailto:support@firebolt.io).
</Note>

### Enable concurrency auto-scaling         
The following code example adjusts the maximum number of engine clusters to enable concurrency auto-scaling: 

```sql
ALTER ENGINE my_engine SET MAX_CLUSTERS = 2;
```

## ALTER ENGINE RENAME TO 
Renames an engine.

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER ENGINE <engine_name> RENAME TO <new_engine_name>
```

### Parameters


| Parameter     | Description                       |
| :------------ |:----------------------------------|
| `<engine_name>` | The name of the engine to rename. |
| `<new_engine_name>`       | The new name of the engine.       |

## ALTER ENGINE OWNER TO

Changes the owner of an engine. You can view the current owner in the the `engine_owner` column of the `information_schema.engines` view.

For more information, see [ownership](/Guides/security/ownership).

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER ENGINE <engine_name> OWNER TO <user>
```

### Parameters 


| Parameter     | Description                                  |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `<engine_name>` | The name of the engine to change the owner of. |
| `<user>`       | The new owner of the engine.                 |
