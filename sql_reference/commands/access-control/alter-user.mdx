### Syntax

```sql
ALTER USER <user_name> SET
	[ LOGIN = <login_name> | DEFAULT ]
        [ SERVICE_ACCOUNT = <service_account_name> | DEFAULT ]
        [ DEFAULT_DATABASE = <database_name> | DEFAULT ]
	[ DEFAULT_ENGINE = <engine_name> | DEFAULT ];
```
or 

```sql
ALTER USER <user_name> RENAME TO <new_user_name>;
```

### Parameters 
 

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<user_name>`                              | The name of the user, may contain non-alpha-numeric characters such as exclamation points (!), percent signs (%), dots (.), underscores (_), dashes (-), and asterisks (*). Strings containing non-alphanumeric characters must be enclosed in single or double quotes. For more information about the full set of naming rules, see the [object identifiers guide](/Reference/object-identifiers#user-names).  |
| `<new_user_name>` | The new name of the user, used with the `RENAME TO` option. The new user name can be any string, and can also contain spaces and non-alpha-numeric characters such as exclamation points (!), percent signs (%), at signs(@), dot signs (.), underscore signs (_), minus signs (-), and asterisks (*). If the string contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters, it must be enclosed in single or double quotes.
| `<login_name>` | An optional, case-insensitive parameter to specify the name of the login to link the user with, used with the `SET` option. This cannot be used in conjunction with the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` parameter - a user can be linked to a login OR a service account but not both. `DEFAULT` disassociates the user from its login. The user will become unusable before it's re-associated with some login or service account. |
| `<service_account_name>` | An optional parameter to specify the name of the service account to link the user with, used with the `SET` option. This cannot be used in conjunction with the `LOGIN` parameter - a user can be linked to a login OR a service account but not both. `DEFAULT` disassociates the user from its service account. The user will become unusable before it's re-associated with some login or service account. |
| `<database_name>`                      | An optional parameter to define a default database for the user. Used with the `SET` option. |
