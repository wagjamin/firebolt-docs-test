The `ST_COVERS` function determines if one `GEOGRAPHY` object fully encompasses another. Specifically, it checks whether every point in the second `GEOGRAPHY` object (`geo2`) lies within or on the boundary of the first `GEOGRAPHY` object (`geo1`). If `geo1` covers `geo2`, the function returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`. This function is commonly used to assess spatial relationships, such as whether a larger geographic area completely includes a smaller one.

If either `geo1` or `geo2` is empty, `ST_COVERS` will return `FALSE`.

Before performing the coverage check, `geo1` and `geo2` are aligned through a snapping process, ensuring precise calculation. For more details on snapping, refer to the [snapping documentation](/geography-data-type#snapping).

## Comparison with [ST_CONTAINS](/functions-reference/geospatial/st_contains)
`ST_COVERS` is similar to `ST_CONTAINS`, but there is a key distinction: `ST_CONTAINS` returns `FALSE` if all points in `geo2` lie exactly on the boundary of `geo1`, while `ST_COVERS` will return `TRUE` in this case. If this distinction is not important, use `ST_COVERS`, which is more efficient to compute in Firebolt.
