Calculates the relative rank of the current row within an ordered data set, as
`( rank - 1 ) / ( rows - 1 )`
where rank is the current row's rank within the partition, and rows is the number of rows in the partition. PERCENT_RANK always returns values from 0 to 1 inclusive. The first row in any set has a `PERCENT_RANK` of 0. 

## Syntax


```sql
PERCENT_RANK() OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <partition_by> ] ORDER BY <order_by> [ASC|DESC] )
```

## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description                                      | Supported input types | 
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------| 
| Parameter | Description                                     |
| `<partition_by>` | An expression used for the partition by clause. | Any |
| `<order_by>` | An expression used for the order by clause. | Any |

## Return Type
`DOUBLE PRECISION`

This function respects `NULL` values, and results will be ordered with default null ordering `NULLS LAST` unless otherwise specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.

## Example


The example below calculates, for each student in grade nine, the percent rank of the student's test score by their grade level.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname, current_score,
	PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY current_score DESC) as percent_rank
FROM
	class_test
WHERE grade_level=9;
```

**Returns**:

| nickname | current_score |    percent_rank     |
