## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description                                      | Supported input types |

## Example


In the example below, the `LAG` function is being used to find the players in each level who ranked before and after a certain player. In some cases, if the player has no one ranked before or after them, the `LAG` function returns `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	level,
	LAG(nickname, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY nickname) AS player_before,
	LAG(first_name, -1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY nickname) AS player_after
FROM
	players;
```

**Returns**:

| nickname | level | player_before | player_after |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------|
| kennethpark      |           9 | NULL        | rileyjon     |
| rileyjon   |           9 | kennethpark       | sabrina21         |
| sabrina21       |           9 | rileyjon    | ymatthews         |
| ymatthews      |           9 | sabrina21       | NULL         |
