## VECTOR_MANHATTAN_DISTANCE

Returns the Manhattan, or L1 distance, between two vectors. The Manhattan distance measures the total distance by moving strictly along orthogonal axes, similar to navigating streets in a city grid. It is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of two vectors.

## Syntax


```sql
VECTOR_MANHATTAN_DISTANCE(<array>, <array>)
```
## Parameters


| Parameter | Description                                        | Supported input types                                           |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<array>` | The first array used in the distance calculation.  | Any array of [numeric data types](/data-types#numeric). |
| `<array>` | The second array used in the distance calculation. | Any array of [numeric data types](/data-types#numeric). |

## Notes
Both input `array` arguments must have the same number of elements.

## Return Type
`DOUBLE`
