## VECTOR_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE

Returns the Euclidean distance, or L2 distance, between two vectors. The Euclidean distance measures the shortest distance between two points in space along a straight line. It is calculated by summing the squared distances of a pair of vector elements, and then taking the square root.

## Syntax


```sql
VECTOR_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE(<array>, <array>)
```
## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description                                        | Supported input types                                           |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<array>` | The first array used in the distance calculation.  | Any array of [numeric data types](/data-types#numeric). |
| `<array>` | The second array used in the distance calculation. | Any array of [numeric data types](/data-types#numeric). |

## Notes
Both input `array` arguments must have the same number of elements.

## Return Type
`DOUBLE`
