Computes the sample variance of all non-`NULL` numeric values produced by an expression. The sample variance measures the average of the squared differences from the sample mean, indicating how spread out the values are within a sample.
For information about the population variance, which measures how spread out the values are within the full population, see [VAR_POP](/functions-reference/aggregation/variance-pop).

**Alias**: `VARIANCE`

## Syntax


```sql
{ VARIANCE | VAR_SAMP }(<expression>)
```
## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description               | Supported input types |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------|
| `<expression>`  | An expression producing numeric values for which to calculate the sample variance. | `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION` |

## Return Type
`VAR_SAMP` returns a result of type `DOUBLE PRECISION`. 


### Special cases
- If there is at most one non-`NULL` input value, the result is `NULL`.
- If the input contains an `Inf` or `NaN` value, the result will be `NaN`.
