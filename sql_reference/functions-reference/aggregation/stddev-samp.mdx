Computes the sample standard deviation of all non-`NULL` numeric values produced by an expression. 
The sample standard deviation measures how spread out values are in a sample by calculating the square root of the average of squared deviations from the sample mean, using a correction for sample size. For information about the population standard deviation, which estimates the spread of values in the full population, see [STDDEV_POP](/functions-reference/aggregation/stddev-pop).

**Alias**: `STDDEV`


## Syntax


```sql
{ STDDEV | STDDEV_SAMP }(<expression>)
```
## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description               | Supported input types |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------|
| `<expression>`  | An expression producing numeric values for which to calculate the sample standard deviation. | `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION` |

## Return Type
`STDDEV_SAMP` returns a result of type `DOUBLE PRECISION`. 


### Special cases
- If there is at most one non-`NULL` input value, the result is `NULL`.
- If the input contains an `Inf` or `NaN` value, the result will be `NaN`.
