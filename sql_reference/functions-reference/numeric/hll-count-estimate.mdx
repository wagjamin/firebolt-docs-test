Extracts a cardinality estimate of a single HLL++ sketch that was previously built using the aggregate
function [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](/functions-reference/aggregation/hll-count-build).

## Syntax

```sql
HLL_COUNT_ESTIMATE(<expression>)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                    | Supported input types |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `<expression>` | An HLL++ sketch produced by the [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](/functions-reference/aggregation/hll-count-build) function. | `BYTEA`               |

## Return Type

`BIGINT`

## Example

Following the [example](/functions-reference/aggregation/hll-count-build#example) in [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](/functions-reference/aggregation/hll-count-build):

```sql
SELECT hll_count_estimate(a) AS hll_estimate
FROM sketch_of_data_to_count
ORDER BY 1;
```

| hll_estimate (BIGINT) |
|:----------------------|
| 3291008               |
| 4948957               |

```sql
SELECT hll_count_estimate(hll_count_merge(a)) AS hll_estimate
FROM sketch_of_data_to_count;
```

| hll_estimate (BIGINT) |
