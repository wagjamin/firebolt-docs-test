The `information_schema.enabled_roles` view lists roles in a Firebolt account that is either owned by a user or comes with [role privileges](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/role-permissions#role-permissions) to access. 

The following code example uses a `SELECT` query to return information about each role:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.enabled_roles;
```

<Note>
For more information about permissions to access and perform operations on specific objects by role, see [Manage role-based access control](/Guides/security/rbac).
