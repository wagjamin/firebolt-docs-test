The system table `information_schema.engine_user_query_history` is a view, which is a virtual table based on [ENGINE_QUERY_HISTORY](/information-schema/engine-query-history). It applies filters to only show queries that were made by actual users.

Queries generated by the system, such as those from connectors, drivers, or SDKs, are marked with the boolean HTTP header `Firebolt-Machine-Query`. These system queries can include actions such UI page loads or query progress updates.
These queries do not appear in `information_schema.engine_user_query_history`, but are available in [ENGINE_QUERY_HISTORY](/information-schema/engine-query-history), which acts as a complete audit log.


```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.engine_user_query_history
LIMIT
  100;
```

## Columns in information_schema.engine_user_query_history

Each row contains columns with detailed information about each query in the history. This schema has the same structure and information as [ENGINE_QUERY_HISTORY](/information-schema/engine-query-history).
