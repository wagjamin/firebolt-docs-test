You can use the `information_schema.engine_running_queries` view to return information about queries currently running in a database. This view is available in each database and includes one row for each running query. The table contains a maximum of ten thousand queries per engine cluster. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each running query as shown in the example below. 

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
   information_schema.engine_running_queries
LIMIT
  100;
```

## Columns in information_schema.engine_running_queries
