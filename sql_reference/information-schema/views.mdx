You can use the `information_schema.views` view to return information about each view in a database. The view is available for each database and contains one row for each view in the database. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each view as shown in the example below.

To access information about views, you must have `USAGE` privileges on both the [schema](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/schema-permissions#schema-level-privileges) and the [database](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/schema-permissions#schema-level-privileges). You also need ownership of the view or [view-level privileges](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/view-permissions#view-permissions). 

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.views;
```
