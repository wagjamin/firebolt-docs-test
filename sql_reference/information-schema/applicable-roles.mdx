The `information_schema.applicable_roles` view shows every role in the account and its grantees, who include other users or roles to whom the role is granted. 

You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each role as shown in the example below.
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.applicable_roles;
```
