The `information_schema.object_privileges` view provides information about permissions granted to each role.  

To be able to access this information, you must have [role privileges](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/role-permissions#role-permissions), ownership of the role, ownership of the object to which the role is granted, or be the member of the role.

All object privileges are explicitly listed in `information_schema.object_privileges`. If the `ANY` privilege is granted on an object, it also shows the corresponding privilege on the object's descendants.

For example, if you grant `USAGE ANY ENGINE` privilege on the account, you will be able to see `USAGE` privilege for all of the engines in the account.

The following code example creates two engines, a role, and grants that role permission to use any engine in the specified account:
```sql
CREATE ENGINE engine1;
CREATE ENGINE engine2;
CREATE ROLE developer_role;
GRANT USAGE ANY ENGINE ON ACCOUNT account_name TO developer_role;
```
Then, the following code example retrieves all privileges granted to the `developer_role` on Firebolt objects, showing the grantor, grantee, object name, object type, and privilege type:
```sql
SELECT
  grantor, grantee, object_name, object_type, privilege_type
FROM
  information_schema.object_privileges
WHERE 
  grantee = 'developer_role';
```

| grantor | grantee | object_name | object_type | privilege_type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| admin_user | role_name |  account_name | account | `USAGE ANY ENGINE` |
| admin_user | role_name |  engine1 | engine | `USAGE` |
| admin_user | role_name |  engine2 | engine | `USAGE` |

### View account, role, user, engine, and database permissions

To view account, role, user, engine and database permissions, make sure that current database is **not** selected. Then, query the `information_schema.object_privileges` view as shown in the following examples:

**View privileges directly under an account**

To view all privileges directly under an account, ensure that no database is selected, and query the `information_schema` as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.object_privileges;
```

You can also deselect the current database in the **Firebolt Develop Space** user interface (UI), by choosing `None` in ![the current database selector](/assets/images/current_database_dropdown_none_option.png).

**View privileges in a specific database**

To view all privileges under a user defined database `db`, specify the database in the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  db.information_schema.object_privileges;
```

### View object permissions in the current database

When the current database is selected,`information_schema.object_privileges` only shows permissions for objects within that database. It does not show permissions for accounts, roles, users, engines, databases, and objects in other databases.

To view permissions for schemas, tables and views in the current database, set the current database with [USE DATABASE](/sql_reference/commands/data-definition/use-database), then select and view privileges in a query as follows:

```sql
USE DATABASE db;

SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.object_privileges;
```

You can also use the ![database selector](/assets/images/current_database_dropdown.png) in the UI.
