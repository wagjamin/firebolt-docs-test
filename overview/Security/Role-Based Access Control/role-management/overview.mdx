Role management in Firebolt allows you to control access to resources within your data warehouse by assigning specific privileges to users and roles. Firebolt supports two types of roles: [system roles](system-roles) and [custom roles](custom-roles). 

<Note>Privileges can be granted to custom roles either by the [account_admin](/Overview/organizations-accounts.md #account-administrative-role) or the [resource owner](../ownership). </Note>
