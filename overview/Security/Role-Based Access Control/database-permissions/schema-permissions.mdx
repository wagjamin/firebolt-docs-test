In Firebolt, a **schema** is a logical namespace within a database that organizes **tables**, **views**, and other objects. Schema-level permissions allow roles to perform specific actions, such as accessing, modifying, or managing objects within a schema.

<Note>To perform actions on a schema or its objects, the role must also have the **USAGE** privilege on the schema's parent database.</Note>

## Schema-level privileges 

| Privilege | Description                                                              | GRANT Syntax                                                                  | REVOKE Syntax                                                                 |

## Examples of granting schema permissions

### USAGE permission

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO developer_role;
```

### MODIFY permission  
The following code example gives the role `developer_role` permission to alter properties or drop the specified schema.

```sql
GRANT MODIFY ON SCHEMA "public" TO developer_role;

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA "public" TO developer_role;
```

### DELETE ANY permission

```

### INSERT ANY permission 
The following code example grants the role `developer_role` permission to [insert](/sql_reference/commands/data-management/insert.md ) rows into all current and future tables in the specified schema:

```sql
GRANT INSERT ANY ON SCHEMA "public" TO developer_role;
```

### UPDATE ANY permission
