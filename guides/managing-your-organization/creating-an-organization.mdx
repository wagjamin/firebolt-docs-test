To start working with Firebolt, you first need to register your organization and create your first account. An organization provides a logical structure for managing accounts, billing, and authentication. [Read more about organizations and accounts and their benefits.](/Overview/organizations-accounts)

When registering to Firebolt, the domain name used in your registration email will determine the organization name. Organization names are globally unique — no two organizations can have the same name. If you need two organizations under the same domain, contact the Firebolt Support team for further assistance.

## Create an organization

To register to Firebolt and create an organization:

1. Go to Firebolt’s registration page: [go.firebolt.io/signup](https://go.firebolt.io/signup)

2. Enter the following information in the form:

   * First name
   * Last name
   * Email - make sure you use a business email address, such as `you@anycorp.com`. Based on that address, Firebolt infers the name of your company and organization. Firebolt does not support usernames with personal email addresses, such as `me@gmail.com` or `you@outlook.com`.
   * Region in which to create your first account. You will be able to create additional accounts in other regions later on, if needed.

3. Click **Register**.

4. An email will be sent to the address provided to verify the organization. When this email is received, click on **Activate**. To move on to the next step, Firebolt will approve your registration request and validate your information - this step might take a couple of minutes to complete.

5. Once approved, you will get a welcome email. Click **Go to Firebolt** in this email.

6. Enter a password as instructed and choose **Set password**.

7. Choose **Log in**. Enter your login information (email address and password) and click **Log in**.

Congratulations - you have successfully set up your organization. Welcome to Firebolt!
