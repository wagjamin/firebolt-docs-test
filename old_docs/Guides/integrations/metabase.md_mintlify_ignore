# Connecting to Metabase
{: .no_toc}

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is an open-source business intelligence platform. You can use Metabase's user interface to explore, analyze, and visualize data, query databases, generate reports, and create dashboards. 

This guide shows you how to [set up a Firebolt connector](#set-up-a-connector-to-metabase) for a self-hosted Metabase instance and how to [create a connection](#create-a-connection-to-metabase). If you are using either the managed or cloud-hosted version of [**Metabase Cloud**](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/cloud/start), you can skip directly to the [Create a Connection](#create-a-connection-to-metabase).

You can also watch a short video on how to connect Metabase to Firebolt:

### Set up a connector to metabase

Metabase can be deployed as a **self-hosted instance**, which is a version that you install and manage on your own server infrastructure. If you are using either the managed or cloud-hosted version of [**Metabase Cloud**](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/cloud/start), you can skip directly to the [Create a Connection](#create-a-connection-to-metabase). 

For self-hosted deployments on-premises, the Firebolt connector must be installed manually using the following steps: 
1. **Download the Firebolt Metabase driver**
* Go to the [GitHub Releases page for Firebolt](https://github.com/firebolt-db/metabase-firebolt-driver/releases).
* Locate the most recent version of the Firebolt driver, and download it.
2. **Move the driver file to the plugins directory**
* Save the downloaded driver file in the `/plugins` directory on your Metabase host system.
* By default, the `/plugins` directory is located in the same folder where the `metabase.jar` file runs.
After completing these steps, the Firebolt connector will be available for configuration within Metabase.

### Create a connection to metabase

After setting up the Firebolt connector, use the following steps to create a connection between Metabase and your Firebolt database:

1. Open your Metabase instance's home page in a web browser.

2. Select **Settings** from the top-right menu of the Metabase interface.

3. Select **Admin** from the dropdown menu.

4. On the **Admin** page, select **Databases** in the top navigation bar.

5. Select the **Add Database** button.
6. From the **Database Type** dropdown list, select **Firebolt**.

    Fill out the required connection details using the descriptions provided in the following table:

    | Field                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    |-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Display Name**            | A name to identify your database in Metabase. Use the same name as your Firebolt database for simplicity.                                                                                                                                            |
    | **Client ID**               | The [service account ID]({% link Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts.md %}#get-a-service-account-id) associated with your Firebolt database.                                                                                          |
    | **Client Secret**           | The [secret for the service account]({% link Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts.md %}#generate-a-secret) associated with your Firebolt database.                                                                                      |
    | **Database name**           | Specify the name of the Firebolt database you want to connect to.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | **Account name**            | The name of your Firebolt account, which is required to log in and authenticate your database connection.                                                                                                                                            |
    | **Engine name**             | Provide the name of the Firebolt engine that will be used to run queries against the database.                                                                                                                                                       |
    | **Additional JDBC options** | Add any extra parameters needed for the connection, such as `connection_timeout_millis=10000`. For more options, access the [JDBC connection parameters guide]({% link Guides/developing-with-firebolt/connecting-with-jdbc.md %}#available-connection-parameters). |


7. Select **Save** to store your database configuration.

Verify the connection by confirming that Metabase displays a success message indicating that your Firebolt database has been added successfully. If the connection fails, double-check your settings and ensure all required fields are correct.
