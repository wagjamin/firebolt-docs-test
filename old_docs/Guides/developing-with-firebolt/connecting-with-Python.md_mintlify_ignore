You can use the Python SDK to work with Firebolt. See the resources below for more information.

* [Firebolt Python SDK documentation](https://python.docs.firebolt.io/sdk_documenation/latest/)
* The [firebolt-python-sdk repository on GitHub](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-python-sdk/)
* Code examples (in Jupyter notebooks) in the SDK repository that demonstrate common [data tasks](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/dbapi.ipynb) and [management tasks](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/management.ipynb)
