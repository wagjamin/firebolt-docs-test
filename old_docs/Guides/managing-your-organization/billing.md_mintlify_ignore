# Billing

Firebolt bills are based on the consumption of resources within each account in your organization. This includes the total amount of data stored and engine usage.

* **Data storage** usage is calculated on the daily average amount of data (in bytes) stored under your Firebolt account name for indexes and raw compressed data.

* **Engine resources** usage is calculated with **one-second granularity** between the time Firebolt makes the engine available for queries and when the the engine moves to the stopped state.

## Set-up account billing through AWS Marketplace
To continue using Firebolt’s engines for query execution after your initial $200 credit, valid for 30 days, you’ll need to set-up a billing account by connecting your account to the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace). 

**Steps for registration:**

1. On the [Firebolt Workspace page](https://go.firebolt.io/), select the **Configure**(<img src="../../assets/images/configure-icon.png" alt="AggIndex" width="14"/>) icon from the left navigation pane. 
2. Under **Organization settings**, select **Billing**.
3. Click **Connect to AWS Marketplace** to take you to the Firebolt page on AWS Marketplace.
4. On the AWS Marketplace page, click the **View Purchase Options** in the top right hand corner of the screen.
5. Click **Setup Your Account**.

Your account should now be associated with AWS Marketplace.

## Invoices

Invoices for Firebolt engines and data are submitted through the AWS Marketplace. The final monthly invoice is available on the third day of each month through the AWS Marketplace. A billing cycle starts on the first day of the month and finishes on the last day of the same month.

## Viewing billing information

Users with the **Org Admin** role can monitor the cost history of each account in the organization.

**To view cost information for your organization**
Organization cost details are captured in two information_schema tables. Query those two tables and retrieve any information about the organization's cost   
1) [Engines billing](../../sql_reference/information-schema/engines-billing.md)
2) [Storage billing](../../sql_reference/information-schema/storage-billing.md)

{: .note}
Firebolt billing is reported to the AWS Marketplace at the beginning of the next day. By default, the **Accounts & Billing** page displays the engine usage breakdown based on billing time. If you prefer to see the engine usage by actual usage day, you can click the **Engines breakdown** selector under the **Usage cost by engine** table and click **Actual running time**.
