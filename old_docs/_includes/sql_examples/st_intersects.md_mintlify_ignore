The following code example constructs two LineStrings near Times Square in New York City from their WKT representations as `GEOGRAPHY` objects and determines if the LineStrings intersect:

``` sql
SELECT ST_INTERSECTS(
    ST_GEOGFROMTEXT('LINESTRING(-73.98507474330196 40.75858394491826, -73.98601039902333 40.7573327842733)'),
    ST_GEOGFROMTEXT('LINESTRING(-73.98625022413634 40.758256445020976, -73.98473358363454 40.757637261118134)')
    ) AS result
```

**Returns**

| result (BOOLEAN) |
