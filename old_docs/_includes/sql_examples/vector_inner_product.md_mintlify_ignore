**Example**

The following code returns the inner product of two vectors that have similar directions and magnitudes:

``` sql
SELECT VECTOR_INNER_PRODUCT([1, 2], [3, 4]) AS product;
```

**Returns**

| product (DOUBLE PRECISION) |
| :--- |
| 11 |

**Example**

The following code returns the inner product of two vectors that are orthogonal to each other:

``` sql
SELECT VECTOR_INNER_PRODUCT([3, 4], [-4, 3]) AS product;
```

**Returns**

| product (DOUBLE PRECISION) |
| :--- |
| 0 |

**Example**

The following code returns the inner product of two vectors that are pointing in very different directions that are not orthogonal:

``` sql
SELECT VECTOR_INNER_PRODUCT([3, 4], [4, -2]) AS product;
```

**Returns**

| product (DOUBLE PRECISION) |
| :--- |
| 4 |
