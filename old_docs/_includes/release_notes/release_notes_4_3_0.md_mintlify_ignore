### HLL-based count distinct functions compatible with the Apache DataSketches library
Firebolt now supports count-distinct functions using the HLL (HyperLogLog) algorithm, compatible with the Apache DataSketches library.
For details and examples, see documentation on the functions 
[APACHE_DATASKETCHES_HLL_BUILD](docs/sql_reference/functions-reference/datasketches/apache-datasketches-hll-build.md),
[APACHE_DATASKETCHES_HLL_MERGE](docs/sql_reference/functions-reference/datasketches/apache-datasketches-hll-merge.md),
and [APACHE_DATASKETCHES_HLL_ESTIMATE](docs/sql_reference/functions-reference/datasketches/apache-datasketches-hll-estimate.md).

### Supported additional join conditions and removed the restriction on the number of inequality predicates
Firebolt has added enhanced support for more join conditions. As long as there is one equality predicate comparing a left column to a right column of the join, which is not part of a disjunctive (OR) expression, the remaining join condition can be arbitrary. The previous limitation on the number of inequality predicates has been removed.

### Temporarily restricted column DEFAULT expressions in CREATE TABLE statements
Column DEFAULT expressions in CREATE TABLE statements have been temporarily restricted, they can only consist of literals and the following functions: `CURRENT_DATE()`, `LOCALTIMESTAMP()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `NOW()`. Existing tables with column DEFAULT expressions are not affected.

### Underflow detection while casting from TEXT to floating point data types
Firebolt now detects underflow, a condition where a numeric value becomes smaller than the minimum limit that a data type can represent, when casting from TEXT to floating point data types. For example, the query `select '10e-70'::float4;` now returns an error, while it previously returned `0.0`.

### Returning query execution errors in JSON format through the HTTP API
Firebolt's HTTP API now returns query execution errors in JSON format, allowing for future enhancements like including metadata such as error codes, or the location of a failing expression within the SQL script.

### Changed default of case_sensitive_column_mapping parameter in COPY FROM
The default value for the `CASE_SENSITIVE_COLUMN_MAPPING` parameter in `COPY FROM` is now `FALSE`, meaning that if a target table contains column names in uppercase and the source file to ingest has the same columns in lowercase, the ingestion will consider them the same column and ingest the data.

### `extract` function returns Numeric(38,9) for Epoch, second, and millisecond extraction
The result data type of the `extract` function for epoch, second, and millisecond was changed to return the type Numeric(38,9) instead of a narrower Numeric type. For example, `select extract(second from '2024-04-22 07:10:20'::timestamp);` now returns Numeric(38,9) instead of Numeric(8,6).

## Performance Improvements

### Multi-node query performance
Firebolt has improved the performance of data transfer between nodes, resulting in faster overall query execution times.

Firebolt has enhanced support for interval arithmetic. You can now use expressions of the form `date_time + INTERVAL * d`, where `date_time` is a expression of type Date, Timestamp, TimestampTz, and `d` is an expression of type DOUBLE PRECISION. The interval is now scaled by `d` before being added to `date_time`. For example, writing `INTERVAL '1 day' * 3` is equivalent to writing `INTERVAL '3 days'`.

### Optimized selective inner and right joins on primary index and partition by columns to reduce rows scanned
Selective inner and right joins on primary index and partition by columns now can now benefit from pruning. This reduces the number of rows scanned by filtering out rows that are not part of the join result early in the process. This optimization works best when joining on the first primary index column or a partition by column. The optimization is applied automatically when applicable, and no action is required. Queries that used this optimization will display "Prune:" labels on the table scan in the EXPLAIN (PHYSICAL) or EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) output.


## Bug Fixes

<!-- Auto Generated Markdown for FIR-34721 - Owned by Demian Hespe -->
### Fixed a bug in the combination of cross join and the `index_of` function 
Resolved an issue where the `index_of` function would fail when applied to the result of a cross join that produced a single row.
