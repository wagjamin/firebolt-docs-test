## DB version 4.6
**September 2024**

### New Features

**`COPY TO` support for the `SNAPPY` compression type**<BR>

[COPY TO]({% link sql_reference/commands/data-management/copy-to.md %}) now supports `SNAPPY` as a new compression option for Parquet files. This enhancement offers greater flexibility for managing file size and performance, particularly for workloads requiring faster compression. Each file is written in Parquet format, with the specified compression applied to the data pages in the column chunks.

**`COPY FROM` support for filtering by source file metadata**<BR>

[COPY FROM]({% link sql_reference/commands/data-management/copy-from.md %}) now supports filtering by source file metadata using the `WHERE` clause.

**Added support for vector distance calculations with new functions**

Firebolt has added support for vector distance and similarity calculations with the following new functions: [VECTOR_COSINE_DISTANCE]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-cosine-distance.md %}), [VECTOR_MANHATTAN_DISTANCE]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-manhattan-distance.md %}), [VECTOR_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-euclidean-distance.md %}), [VECTOR_SQUARED_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-squared-euclidean-distance.md %}), [VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-cosine-similarity.md %}), and [VECTOR_INNER_PRODUCT]({% link sql_reference/functions-reference/vector/vector-inner-product.md %}).

### Behavior Changes

**Introduced `SHOW CATALOGS` statement and aliased `SHOW DATABASES` to it while deprecating `SHOW DATABASE X`**
{: style="color:red;"}

A new statement `SHOW CATALOGS` now acts as an alias for `SHOW DATABASES`. The statement `SHOW DATABASE X` is no longer supported.

**`COPY FROM` now unzips Parquet files with gzip extensions**
{: style="color:red;"}

Before version 4.6, the `COPY FROM` command did not apply file-level decompression to Parquet files with a `.gzip` or `.gz` extension. The command treated these files as standard Parquet files, assuming that any compression existed only within the internal Parquet format structure.

With the release of version 4.6, `COPY FROM` now processes Parquet files similarly to other formats. When a Parquet file has a `.gz` or `.gzip` extension, the command will first decompress the file before reading it as a Parquet format file. Hence, it will now fail while reading internally compressed Parquet files with gzip extensions. Users experiencing issues with loading files after this change should contact the support team at support@firebolt.io for assistance.

### Bug Fixes

<!-- Auto Generated Markdown for FIR-35653 - Owned by Alex Hall -->
**Fixed a rare bug that caused some query failures from incorrect computation of cacheable subresults**

Fixed a rare bug impacting the logic that determined which subresults could be cached and reused. This issue could have caused query failures in certain patterns, but it did not impact the accuracy of the query outcomes.

**Updated name of aggregatefunction2 to aggregatefunction in explain output**

The name `aggregatefunction2` has been updated to `aggregatefunction` in the [EXPLAIN]({% link sql_reference/commands/queries/explain.md %}) output.

**Fixed incorrect results in `ARRAY_AGG` expressions by excluding `NULL` values for false conditions in aggregating indexes**

Aggregate expressions like `ARRAY_AGG(CASE WHEN <cond> THEN <column> ELSE NULL END)` previously returned incorrect results by excluding `NULL` values for rows when the condition was `FALSE`.
