# SELECT
{: .no_toc}

Retrieves specific data from one or more tables in a database based on certain criteria. If you run multiple `SELECT` queries in a single script, you must them with a semicolon (`;`). Firebolt also supports `CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT` (CTAS). For more information, see [CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT](../data-definition/create-fact-dimension-table-as-select.md).

* Topic ToC
{:toc}

## Syntax

```sql
[ WITH <with_query> [, ...n] ]
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] {<select_expr> [, ...]}
    [ FROM <from_item> [, ...] ]
    [ WHERE <condition> ]
    [ GROUP BY [ <grouping_element> [, ...] | ALL ] ]
    [ HAVING <condition> [, ...] ]
    [ UNION [ ALL ] <select_expr> [ ...n]
    [ ORDER BY <expression> [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] [, ...] ]
    [ LIMIT <count> ]
    [ OFFSET <start> ]
```


## SELECT

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] {<select_expression> [, ...]}
```

The `SELECT` list defines the columns that it returns. Each `<select_expression>` in the `SELECT` list can be either an individual expression or a wildcard.

{: .note}
You cannot select **only** [partitioned]({% link Overview/indexes/using-indexes.md %}#partitions-in-tables) or [virtual columns](../../../Guides/loading-data/working-with-external-tables.md#using-metadata-virtual-columns). Selecting both partitioned or virtual columns together with regular columns is supported, but selecting only partitioned or virtual columns is not. 

### SELECT expression

```sql
<expression> [ AS <alias> ]
```

Expressions in the `SELECT` list return a single value and generate one output column. You can define the column name using an explicit alias with the `AS` clause, or, for expressions without explicit alias, the output column name is automatically generated. 
Expressions can reference any column from the `FROM` clause, but cannot reference other columns produced by the same `SELECT` list. The expressions can use scalar functions, aggregate functions, window functions or subqueries, as long as they return a single value.

#### Example

The following code retrieves the `currentscore`, `currentspeed`, and the product of `currentlevel` and `playterid` as `score_information from the `playstats` table:

```sql
SELECT currentscore, currentspeed, currentlevel * playterid AS score_information FROM playstats
```

### SELECT wildcard

```sql
[ <table_name>. ] * [ EXCLUDE { <column_name> | ( <column_name>, ... ) } ]
```

Wildcards are expanded into multiple output columns based on the following rules:

* The wildcard symbol (`*`) expands to include all columns in the `FROM` clause.
* `<table_name>.*` expands to include all columns specified in the `FROM` clause for the table named `<table_name>`
* `EXCLUDE` defines columns which are removed from the previous expansion.

### SELECT DISTINCT

The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement removes duplicate rows.

### SELECT ALL

The `SELECT ALL` statement returns all rows. `SELECT ALL` is the default behavior.


## WITH

The `WITH` clause refactors subqueries so that you can define them once and reference them within the main query. This simplifies the hierarchy of the main query, enabling you to avoid using multiple nested sub-queries.

In order to reference the data from the `WITH` clause, a name must be specified for it. This name is then treated as a temporary relation table during query execution.

The primary query and the queries included in the `WITH` clause are all run at the same time; `WITH` queries are evaluated only once every time the main query runs, even if the clause is referred to by the main query more than once.

### Materialized common table expressions
{: .no_toc}

The query hint `MATERIALIZED` or `NOT MATERIALIZED` controls whether common table expressions (CTEs) produce an internal results table that is cached in engine RAM (`MATERIALIZED`) or calculated each time the sub-query runs. `NOT MATERIALIZED` is the default. `MATERIALIZED` must be specified explicitly.

Materialized results can be accessed more quickly in some circumstances. By using the proper materialization hint, you can control when a CTE gets materialized and improve query performance. We recommend the `MATERIALIZED` hint to improve query performance in the following circumstances:

* The CTE is reused at the main query level more than once.

* The CTE is computationally expensive, producing a relatively small number of rows.

* The CTE calculation is independent of the main query, and no external optimizations from the main table are needed for it to be fast.

* The materialized CTE fits into the nodesâ€™ RAM.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
WITH <subquery_table_name> AS [ MATERIALIZED| NOT MATERIALIZED ] <subquery>
```

| Component               | Description                                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<subquery_table_name>` | A unique name for a temporary table.                                                       |
| `<subquery>`            | Any query statement.                                                                  |

### Example
{: .no_toc}

The following example retrieves all players who have subscribed to receive the game newsletter, having the results of the `WITH` query in the temporary table `nl_subscribers`.

The results of the main query then list the `nickname` and `email` for those customers, sorted by nickname.

```sql
WITH nl_subscribers AS (
	SELECT
		*
	FROM
		players
	WHERE
		issubscribedtonewsletter=TRUE
)
SELECT
	nickname,
	email
FROM
	nl_subscribers
ORDER BY
	nickname
```

## FROM

Use the `FROM` clause to list the tables and any relevant join information and functions necessary for running the query.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
FROM <from_item> [, ...n]
```

| Component     | Description                                                           |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<from_item>` | Indicates the table or tables from which the data is to be retrieved. |

### Example
{: .no_toc}

In the following example, the query retrieves all entries from the `players` table for which the `agecategory` value is "56+".

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	players
WHERE
	agecategory='56+'
```

### `FROM` first
Firebolt allows using the `FROM` clause before the `SELECT` clause. The previous example can also be written as follows:

```sql
FROM players
SELECT *
WHERE agecategory='56+'
```

You can also omit the `SELECT` clause and use only the `FROM` clause in the query as shown in the following code example:

```sql
FROM players
```

The previous code example is equivalent to the following:

```sql
FROM players SELECT *
``` 

## JOIN

A `JOIN` operation combines rows from two data sources, such as tables or views, and creates a new table of combined rows that can be used in a query.  

`JOIN` operations can be used with an `ON` clause for conditional logic or a `USING` clause to specify columns to match.

### JOIN with ON clause syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
FROM <join_table1> [ INNER | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL ] JOIN <join_table2> ON <join_condition>
```

|     Parameters      |                                                                          Description                                                                          |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<join_table1>`       | A table or view to be used in the join operation.                                                                                                              |
| `<join_table2>`       | A second table or view to be used in the join operation.                                                                                                       |
| `ON <join_condition>` | One or more `BOOLEAN` comparison expressions that specify the logic to join two specified tables and which columns to compare. For example: `ON join_table1.column = join_table2.column`. |



### JOIN with USING clause syntax  
{: .no_toc}

```sql
FROM <join_table1> [ INNER | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL ] JOIN <join_table2> USING (column_list)
```

|      Component      |                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<join_table1>`       | A table or view to be used in the join operation.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `<join_table2>`       | A second table or view to be used in the join operation.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `USING (column_list)` | A list of one or more columns to compare for exact matching. `USING` is a shortcut to join tables that share the same column names. The specified columns are joined via a basic match condition. The match condition of `USING (column_list)` is equivalent to `ON join_table1.column = join_table2.column` |

### JOIN types
{: .no_toc}

The type of `JOIN` operation specifies which rows are included between two specified tables. If unspecified, `JOIN` defaults to `INNER JOIN`.

`JOIN` types include:


| `[INNER] JOIN`        |  When used with an `ON` clause, `INNER JOIN` includes only rows that satisfy the `<join_condition>`. When used with a `USING` clause, `INNER JOIN` includes rows only if they have matching values for the specified columns in the `column_list`. |
| `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN`   |  Includes all rows from `<join_table1>` but excludes any rows from `<join_table2>` that donâ€™t satisfy the `<join_condition>`. `LEFT JOIN` is equivalent to `LEFT OUTER JOIN`.                                           |
| `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`  |  Includes all rows from `<join_table2>` but excludes any rows from `<join_table1>` that donâ€™t satisfy the `<join_condition>`. `RIGHT JOIN` is equivalent to `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.                                         |
| `FULL [OUTER] JOIN`   |  Includes all rows from both tables matched where appropriate with the `<join_condition>`. `FULL JOIN` is equivalent to `FULL OUTER JOIN`.                                                                              |
| `CROSS JOIN`          |  Includes every possible combination of rows from `<join_table1>` and `<join_table2>`. A `CROSS JOIN` does not use an `ON` or `USING` clause.                                                                           |

### Examples
{: .no_toc}

The following `JOIN` examples use two tables, `level_one_players` and `level_two_players`. These tables are created and populated with data as follows.

```sql
CREATE DIMENSION TABLE level_one_players (
    nickname TEXT,
    currentscore INTEGER);

INSERT INTO num_test VALUES
    ('kennethpark', 11),
    ('rileyjon', 50),
    ('sabrina21', 90),
    ('steven70', 50)

CREATE DIMENSION TABLE level_two_players (
    nickname TEXT,
    currentscore INTEGER);

INSERT INTO num_test2 VALUES
    ('aaronbutler', 90),
    ('esimpson', 56),
    ('ruthgill', 85),
    ('adrianachoi', 50)

```

The tables and their data are shown as follows:

| level_one_players.nickname | level_one_players.currentscore | level_two_players.nickname| level_two_players.currentscore |
| :--------------------| :----------------| :---------------------| :-----------------|
| kennethpark              |             11 | aaronbutler               |              90 |
| rileyjon             |             50 | esimpson              |              56 |
| sabrina21              |             90 | ruthgill                 |              85 |
| steven70              |             50 | adrianachoi               |              50 |


#### INNER JOIN example
{: .no_toc}

The `INNER JOIN` example below includes only the rows where the `nickname` and `currenscore` values match.

``` sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    level_one_players
INNER JOIN
    level_two_players
    USING (
        nickname,
        currentscore
	);
```

The previous query is equivalent to the following:

``` sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    level_one_players
INNER JOIN
    level_two_players
        ON level_one_players.nickname = level_two_players.nickname
        AND level_one_players.currentscore = level_two_players.score;
```

**Returns**

| level_one_players.nickname | level_one_players.currentscore | level_two_players.nickname| level_two_players.currentscore |
| :-----------| :-------| :------------| :--------|
| lauradavis     |    90 | lauradavis      |     90 |
| hamiltonjorge     |    50 | hamiltonjorge      |     50 |
| adrian26    |    50 | adrian26     |     50 |

| rachelortiz     |    87 | rachelortiz      |     87 |

#### LEFT OUTER JOIN example
{: .no_toc}

The following `LEFT OUTER JOIN` example includes all `nickname` values from the `level_one_players` table. Any rows with no matching value in the `level_two_players` table return `NULL`.  

``` sql
SELECT
    level_one_players.nickname,
    level_two_players.nickname
FROM level_one_players
LEFT OUTER JOIN
    level_two_players
    USING (nickname);
```

**Returns**

| level_one_players.nickname | level_two_players.nickname |
|:-----------| :------------|
| kennethpark     | kennethpark      |
| rileyjon     | rileyjon      |
| sabrina21     | NULL       |
| steven70    | steven70     |


#### RIGHT OUTER JOIN example
{: .no_toc}

The following `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` example includes all `nickname` values from `level_two_players`. Any rows with no matching values in the `level_one_players` table return `NULL`.

``` sql

    level_one_players.nickname,
    level_two_players.nickname
FROM
    level_one_players
RIGHT OUTER JOIN
    level_two_players
    USING (nickname);
```

**Returns**

| NULL      | adrianachoi     |

#### FULL OUTER JOIN example
{: .no_toc}

The following `FULL OUTER JOIN` example includes all values from `num_test` and `num_test2`. Any rows with no matching values return `NULL`.

``` sql
SELECT
    level_one_players.nickname,
    level_two_players.nickname
FROM
    level_one_players
FULL OUTER JOIN
    level_two_players
    USING (nickname);
```

**Returns**

| NULL      | aaronbutler        |
| NULL      | ruthgill       |
| NULL      | adrianachoi     |

#### CROSS JOIN example
{: .no_toc}

A `CROSS JOIN` produces a table with every combination of row values in the specified columns.

The following example uses two tables with player information, `beginner_player` and `intermediate_player`, each with a single `level` column. The tables contain the following data:

| beginner_player.level | intermediate_player.level |
| :-----------| :------------|
| 1     | 4      |
| 2     | 5      |
| 3   | 6    |

The following `CROSS JOIN` example produces a table of every possible pairing of these rows.

``` sql
SELECT
    beginner_player.level,
    intermediate_player.level
FROM
    beginner_player
CROSS JOIN
    intermediate_player;
```

**Returns**

| beginner_player.level | intermediate_player.letter |
| :-------| :---------|
| 1      | 4       |
| 1      | 5       |
| 1      | 6       |
| 2      | 4       |
| 2      | 5       |
| 2      | 6       |
| 3      | 4       |
| 3      | 5       |
| 3      | 6       |



## UNNEST

`UNNEST` is a table-valued function (TVF) that transforms an input row containing an array into a set of rows.
The output table repeats rows of the input table for every element of the array.
Every array element is attached to one of the output rows.
If the input array is empty, the corresponding row is eliminated.

### Syntax - FROM Clause
{: .no_toc}

Using TVFs such as `UNNEST` is permitted in `FROM` clauses as follows:

```sql
FROM <from_items>, UNNEST(<array_column> [,<array_column>...]) [[ AS ] <row_alias>]
```

| Component     | Description                                                                                                               | Valid values and syntax                |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `<from_items>` | The tables containing the array columns that should be unnested.                                          |                                        |
| `<array_column>`      | The array columns to unnest, which can be either an array literal or a reference to an array-typed column. | Any valid array literal or column name. |
| `<row_alias>`      | An alias for the result row, such as `r(x)`. | |

The previous query performs a lateral join onto the result of the `UNNEST` operation.
However, the `LATERAL` keyword is optional.

### Syntax - SELECT Clause
{: .no_toc}

When unnesting a single column, the TVF can also be invoked directly in the `SELECT` clause.

```sql
SELECT <select_list>, UNNEST(<array_column>) [[ AS ] <column_alias>]
```

| Component     | Description                                                                                                               | Valid values and syntax                |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `<select_list>` | The regular select list of your SQL query.                                          |                                        |
| `<array_column>`      | The array columns to unnest, which can be either an array literal or a reference to an array-typed column. | Any valid array literal or column name. |
| `<column_alias>`      | A column alias for the result column, such as `x`. | |

### Example
{: .no_toc}

The example is based on the following table:

```sql
CREATE FACT TABLE players 
(
    player TEXT,
    completed_levels ARRAY(INTEGER)
) PRIMARY INDEX product;
```

Assume the table was populated and contains the following values:

| player | completed_levels     |
| :------- | :-------- |
| kennethpark   | \[2,5]   |
| sabrina21  | \[3,6,7] |
| andres | \[] |

The following query with `UNNEST`:

```sql
SELECT
    player,
    completed_levels,
    completed
FROM
    players, UNNEST(completed_levels) as r(completed);
```

Returns the following result:

| player | completed_levels |Â completed |
| :------- | :------- | :---- |
| kennethpark  | \[2,5] | 2    |
| kennethpark  | \[2,5] | 5    |
| sabrina21  | \[3,6,7] | 3    |
| sabrina21  | \[3,6,7] | 6    |
| sabrina21  | \[3,6,7] | 7    |

The above query can be rewritten to invoke `UNNEST` in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT
    player,
    completed_levels,
    UNNEST(completed_levels) as completed
FROM
    players;
```

## WHERE

Use the `WHERE` clause to define conditions for the query in order to filter the query results. When included, the `WHERE` clause always follows the `FROM` clause as part of a command such as `SELECT`.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
WHERE <condition>
```

| Component     | Description                            | Valid values and syntax       |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `<condition>` | Indicates the conditions of the query. | Any valid `BOOLEAN` expression. |

### Example
{: .no_toc}

In the following example, the query retrieves all entries from the `customers` table for which the `region` value is "EMEA".

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	players
WHERE
	region = 'EMEA'
```

The following query retrieves users who registered after August 30, 2020 from the `players` table:

```sql
SELECT
	playerid,
	email,
	nickname
FROM
	players
WHERE
	registeredon >= TO_DATE('2020-08-30');
```

The following query retrieves users who registered after August 30, 2020:

```sql
SELECT
	playerid,
	email,
SELECT
	playerid,
	email,
	nickname
FROM
	players
WHERE
	registeredon >= TO_DATE('2020-08-30')
	AND user_id IN (
		SELECT

## GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause groups together input rows. Multiple input rows which have same values of expressions in the `GROUP BY` clause become a single row in the output. `GROUP BY` is typically used in conjunction with aggregate functions such as `SUM` and `MIN`. Query with `GROUP BY` clause and without aggregate functions is equivalent to `SELECT DISTINCT`. 


### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY [ <grouping_element> [, ...n] | ALL ]s
```

| Component          | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`<grouping_element>`| A column reference, a position from the select list, a complex expression, or a `GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP`, or `CUBE` clause (see below). |

### Example
{: .no_toc}

In the following example, the retrieved results are grouped by the `nickname` column, and then by the `email` column.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	email,
	sum(agecategory)
FROM
	purchases
GROUP BY
	nickname,
	email
```

If the expression in `GROUP BY` clause is exactly the same as in the `SELECT` list, then its position can be used instead.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	email,
	SUM(agecategory)
FROM
	players
GROUP BY
	1,
	2
```

The `GROUP BY` clause must include all expressions in the `SELECT` list that do not use aggregate functions.
It may include expressions which are not part of `SELECT` list.

```sql
SELECT SUM(agecategory) FROM players GROUP BY nickname
```

The following will cause an error, since `SELECT` list has an expression which is not an aggregate function, and it is not listed in `GROUP BY` clause.

```sql 
SELECT nickname, email, SUM(agecategory) FROM players GROUP BY playerid
```

#### GROUP BY ALL

For the common case of `GROUP BY` clause repeating all the non-aggregate function expressions in the `SELECT` list, it is possible to use `GROUP BY ALL` syntax.
It will automatically group by all non-aggregate functions expressions from the `SELECT` list.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	email,
	SUM(currentscore)
FROM
	players
GROUP BY ALL
```

#### GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
`GROUPING SETS` are an extension of `GROUP BY` that allow specifying multiple `GROUP BY` groups in one statement.

Note that the total number of all grouping sets generated by the combination of all `GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP`, and `CUBE` clauses cannot exceed 4096.

##### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( [ <grouping_set_arg> [, ...n] ] )
```

| Component          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|`<grouping_set_arg>`| A proper `<grouping_set>`, a singleton set represented by a `<grouping_element>`, or an empty set represented by a `<grand_total>`. Each argument produces a result equivalent to a simple `GROUP BY <grouping_set_arg>`.   |
|`<grouping_set>`    | A comma separated list of `<grouping_element>` wrapped in parentheses `( <grouping_element> [, <grouping_element> ] )`.                                                                                                   |
|`<grouping_element>`| A column reference, a position from the `SELECT` list or a complex expression. Note that we allow at most 31 distinct grouping elements in the entire `GROUP BY` clause.                                                  |
|`<grand_total>`     | The empty grouping set `()`.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

##### Example
{: .no_toc}

We want to determine the number of players in each age category, segmented by whether they are subscribed to the newsletter or not. 
Additionally, we want to find the total number of players per age category and the overall amount of players.

```sql
SELECT
    agecategory,
    issubscribedtonewsletter,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    players
GROUP BY 
    GROUPING SETS ((agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter), agecategory, ())
```

The grouping sets in this example are `(agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter)`, `agecategory`, and `()`.
Each set corresponds to one of the groups described earlier.

The query using these grouping sets is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT
    agecategory,
    issubscribedtonewsletter,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    players
GROUP BY 
    agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter
UNION ALL
SELECT
    agecategory,
    NULL as issubscribedtonewsletter,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    players
GROUP BY 
    agecategory
UNION ALL
SELECT
    NULL as agecategory, 
    NULL as issubscribedtonewsletter,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    players
```

Note that the empty grouping set `()` corresponds to a query with an aggregate function but without a `GROUP BY` clause.
For columns not included in a particular grouping set, their values are set to `NULL` in the resulting rows.

#### GROUP BY ROLLUP
`ROLLUP` is syntactic sugar for a common `GROUPING SETS` use case. 
It takes `n` arguments and produces the `n+1` prefixes of these arguments as grouping sets.

Note that the total number of all grouping sets generated by the combination of all `GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP`, an `CUBE` clauses cannot exceed 4096.

##### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY ROLLUP ([ <grouping_element> [, ...n] ])
```
##### Example
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY ROLLUP (agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter)
```
is expanded to
```sql
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter), agecategory, ())
```

#### GROUP BY CUBE
`CUBE` is syntactic sugar for a common `GROUPING SETS` use case. 
It takes `n` arguments and produces the possible <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> subsets as grouping sets.

Note that the total number of all grouping sets generated by the combination of all `GROUPING SETS`, `ROLLUP`, an `CUBE` clauses cannot exceed 4096.
This means that a `GROUP BY` clause with a sinle `CUBE` expression can have at most <code>12 = log<sub>2</sub>(4096)</code> arguments.

##### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY CUBE ([ <grouping_element> [, <grouping_element> ] ])
```

##### Example
{: .no_toc}

```sql
GROUP BY CUBE (agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter)
```
is expanded to
```sql
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter), agecategory, issubscribedtonewsletter, ())
```

## HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause, and is computed after computing the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions.
`HAVING` is used to further eliminate groups that don't satisfy the `<condition>` by filtering the `GROUP BY` results.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
HAVING <condition> [, ...n]
```

| Component     | Description                                                              |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<condition>` | Indicates the boolean condition by which the results should be filtered. |

## UNION [ALL]

The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single query.

* `UNION` combines with duplicate elimination.
* `UNION ALL` combines without duplicate elimination.

When including multiple clauses, the same number of columns must be selected by all participating `SELECT` statements. Data types of all column parameters must be the same. Multiple clauses are processed left to right. Use parentheses to define an explicit order for processing.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
<select_expression1> UNION [ALL] <select_expression2> [ ...n]
```

| Component        | Description                                                  |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<select_expression1>` | A `SELECT`statement.                                         |
| `<select_expression2>` | A second `SELECT` statement to be combined with the first.   |

## ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts a result set by one or more output expressions. `ORDER BY` is evaluated as the last step after any `GROUP BY` or `HAVING` clause. `ASC` and `DESC` determine whether results are sorted in ascending or descending order. When the clause contains multiple expressions, the result set is sorted according to the first expression. Rows with the same values for the first expression are then sorted by the second expression, and this process continues for subsequent expressions.

The `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST` options can be used to determine whether `NULL` values appear before or after non-`NULL` values in the sort order. By default, `NULL` values are considered greater than any non-`NULL` value. `NULLS FIRST` is the default for descending order, and `NULLS LAST` is the default for ascending order.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
ORDER BY <expression> [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] [, ...]
```

| Component                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<expression>`                 | Each expression may specify output columns from `SELECT` or an ordinal number for an output column by position, starting at one.                                                                             |
| `[ ASC | DESC ]`              | Indicates whether the sort should be in ascending or descending order.                                                                                                                                       |
| `[ NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]` | Indicates whether null values should be included at the beginning or end of the result. `NULLS FIRST` is the default for `DESC` order, and `NULLS LAST` otherwise. |

## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows that are included in the result set.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
LIMIT <count>
```

| Component | Description                                          | Valid values and syntax |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `<count>` | Indicates the number of rows that should be returned. | An integer.              |


## OFFSET

The `OFFSET` clause specifies a non-negative number of rows that are skipped before returning results from the query. 

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
OFFSET <start>
```

| Component | Description                                          | Valid values and syntax |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `<start>` | Indicates the number of rows that should be skipped. | An integer.              |

## VALUES Lists

`VALUES` creates an in-memory "constant table" with one or multiple rows for use in queries.
Each parenthesized list of expressions represents a row.
All rows must have the same number of elements, and corresponding elements in each row must have compatible data types.
As an example:
```
SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')) AS t (num, letter);
```
is effectively equivalent to:
```
SELECT 1 AS num, 'one' AS letter
UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 'two'
UNION ALL
SELECT 3, 'three';
```
Syntactically, `VALUES` can be used anywhere a `SELECT` is allowed.

### Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```
VALUES ( <expression> [, ...] ) [, ...]
```
