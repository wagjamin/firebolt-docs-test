# Information schema for transitive_applicable_roles

The `information_schema.applicable_roles` view shows every role in the account and its grantees, who include other users or roles to whom the role is granted. 

Unlike, `information_schema.applicable_roles` that shows only direct grantees, `information_schema.transitive_applicable_roles` also shows indirect grantees.
For example, if role `engineer` is granted to role `manager` and role `manager` is granted to user `alice` then user `alice` is a direct grantee of `manager` and an indirect grantee of `engineer`.

You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each role as shown in the example below.
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.transitive_applicable_roles;
```

See also `information_schema.applicable_roles` [here](applicable-roles.md).
