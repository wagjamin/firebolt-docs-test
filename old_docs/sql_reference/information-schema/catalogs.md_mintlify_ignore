# Information schema for catalogs

You can use the `information_schema.catalogs` view to get information about catalogs (databases in SQL terminology). You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each database as shown in the example below.

In order to view catalog information, you must have [catalog]({% link Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/index.md %}#database-level-privileges) privileges or have ownership of the catalog object.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.catalogs;
```

## Columns in information_schema.catalogs

Each row has the following columns with information about the database.

| Column Name                   | Data Type  | Description |
