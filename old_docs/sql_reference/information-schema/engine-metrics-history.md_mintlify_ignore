# Information schema for engine metrics history

You can use the `information_schema.engine_metrics_history` view to return information about the resource consumption of your engine. As engines can have 1 or more engine clusters that are transient, this provides visibilty into the utilization of each engine cluster. Each row represents the aggregate resource metrics for a single engine cluster at the given event time. Per default, we collect 2 metric snapshots per minute for the last 30 days. You can use a `SELECT` query to return the metrics for each engine cluster at a given point in time as shown in the example below.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.engine_metrics_history
WHERE
  event_time > now() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
LIMIT 100;
```
