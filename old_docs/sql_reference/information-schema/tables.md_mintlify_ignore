# Information schema for tables

You can use the `information_schema.tables` view to return information about each table in a database. The view is available for each database and contains one row for each table in the database. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each table as shown in the example below.

To view table information, you must have `USAGE` privileges on both the [schema]({% link Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/schema-permissions.md %}#schema-level-privileges) and the [database]({% link Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/index.md %}#database-level-privileges). You also need ownership of the table or the necessary [table-level privileges]({% link Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/database-permissions/table-permissions.md %}#table-level-privileges) required for the intended action. 

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.tables;
```
