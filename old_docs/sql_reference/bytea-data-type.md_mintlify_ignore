# BYTEA data type
{:.no_toc}

This topic describes the Firebolt implementation of the `BYTEA` data type.

Not all functions support the `BYTEA` data type currently. For more information, see [BYTEA functions](./functions-reference/bytea/index.md)

## Overview

The `BYTEA` data type is a variable length binary string data type, commonly used to store binary data, like images, other multimedia files, or raw bytes of information. A binary string is a sequence of bytes - unlike `TEXT`, there is no character set. The `BYTEA` data type is nullable.

### Type conversions

The `BYTEA` type can be cast to and from the `TEXT` data type. A cast from `BYTEA` to `TEXT` will interpret the binary string to a hexadecimal representation with `\x` as a prefix. For example `SELECT 'a'::BYTEA::TEXT` returns `\x61`.

Cast from `TEXT` to `BYTEA` supports two formats, **hex** and **escaped**:

**Hex**<br>
Using hex format, the `TEXT` type data must start with `\x`. Characters `\n`, `\t`, `\r` and ' ' are ignored if they are not in sequence of two characters representing one byte. Each character must be in one of the following ranges: `a-f`, `A-F`, `0-9`.<br>Characters must be in pairs. For example, `\x    aa  ` is a valid hex format, but `\xa a` is invalid.


**Escape**<br>
Using escape format, an escaped backslash becomes just a single backslash: `\\` -> `\`. One backslash must be followed by 3 numbers representing octal value (base 8) in range of `000-377`. For example, `a \375`

In addition to casting, the [ENCODE](./functions-reference/bytea/encode.md) and [DECODE](./functions-reference/bytea/decode.md) functions can be used to represent `TEXT` as `BYTEA` and vice versa, but will behave slightly differently. For example, `SELECT ENCODE('1'::BYTEA, 'HEX');` returns `31`, while `SELECT CAST('1'::BYTEA as TEXT);` returns `\x31`, both of type `TEXT`.

### Comparison operator

The `BYTEA` comparison operator will work as lexicographical comparison but with bytes. Two empty `BYTEA` type expressions are equal. If two `BYTEA` type expressions have equivalent bytes and are of the same length, then they are equal. In a greater than (>) or less than (<) comparison, two `BYTEA` type expressions are compared byte by byte, and the first mismatching byte defines which is greater or less than the other.

**Examples:**

`SELECT '\xa3'::BYTEA > '\xa2'::BYTEA;` returns `TRUE`.

`SELECT '\xa3'::BYTEA = '\xa300'::BYTEA;` returns `FALSE`.

`SELECT '\xa3'::BYTEA < '\xa300'::BYTEA;` returns `TRUE`.

### Literal string interpretation

Literal strings will be interpreted according to the setting [`standard_conforming_strings`,](../Reference/system-settings.md#enable-parsing-for-literal-strings) which controls whether strings are parsed with or without escaping.
Similar to [CAST](./functions-reference/conditional-and-miscellaneous/cast.md)  from `TEXT` to `BYTEA`, the two text formats hex and escape are supported.

**Examples:**

```sql
SET standard_conforming_strings = false;
SELECT '\x3132'::BYTEA; -> '\x313332'
SELECT '\x31   32  '::BYTEA; -> '\x3120202033322020'
SELECT 'a b\230a'::BYTEA; -> '\x61206232333061'

set standard_conforming_strings = true;
SELECT '\x3132'::BYTEA; -> '\x3132'
SELECT '\x31   32  '::BYTEA; -> '\x3132'
SELECT 'a b\230a'::BYTEA; -> '\x6120629861'
```

### Output format

The output format for `BYTEA` is the hexadecimal representation of the bytes in lower case prefixed by `\x` (Note: in JSON `\` is escaped).

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT 'a'::BYTEA;
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
    "data":
    [
        ["\\x61"]
    ]
}
```

### Importing `BYTEA` from external source

The input format for importing binary data from an external source depends on the external file format.

**For ORC or PARQUET files:** 
For a specific field type without annotation (UTF-8 for example): BYTE_ARRAY (binary), bytes will be imported exactly as they are in the source.
All the other types will be imported to the corresponding datatype (for example, BYTE_ARRAY with UTF-8 annotation will be imported to `TEXT` data type)
and then cast to type `BYTEA`.

**For CSV, TSV, or JSON files:**
The input data are read exactly as they are in the source, and then cast to data type `BYTEA`.

{: .note}
JSON files must be UTF-8 encoded; however this is not required for CSV and TSV files. In the case that these files are not UTF-8 encoded, field values must not start with `\x` - data starting with the characters `\x` will throw an error on ingest. Any data not starting with the characters `\x` will be copied as bytes to the column of data type `BYTEA`.

**CSV File Example:**

*file*
```csv
'row1'
'aï¿½a'
'\xaabf'
15
'15'
```
**SQL**
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ex_table
(
    column1 BYTEA
) URL = 's3://...'
  OBJECT_PATTERN = '...'
  TYPE = (CSV);

SELECT * FROM ex_table;
```
**Returns:**
```table
| column1    |
| ---------- |
| \x726f7731 |
| \x61ff61   |
| \xaabf     |
| \x3135     |
| \x3135     |
```
