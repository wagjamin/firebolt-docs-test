# PERCENTILE_CONT

Calculates a percentile over a partition, assuming a continuous distribution of values defined. Results are interpolated, rather than matching any of the specific column values. 

PERCENTILE\_CONT is available as an Window function. See also [PERCENTILE\_DISC](../window/percentile-disc-window.md), which returns a percentile over a partition equal to a specific column value. For more information on usage, please refer to [Window Functions](../window/index.md).

## Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
PERCENTILE_CONT( <value> ) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY <order_by> [ { ASC | DESC } ] ) [ OVER ( PARTITION BY <partition_by> ) ]
```

## Parameters 
{: .no_toc}

| Parameter | Description                                      |Supported input types |

## Example
{: .no_toc}

The example below calculates the max percentile value based on continuous distribution of players, partitioned by game level. 

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(1.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY current_score) OVER (PARTITION BY leve;) AS percentile
FROM
	players;
```

**Returns**:

| nickname | percentile |
