# HLL_COUNT_ESTIMATE

Extracts a cardinality estimate of a single HLL++ sketch that was previously built using the aggregate
function [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](../aggregation/hll-count-build.md).

## Syntax

{: .no_toc}

```sql
HLL_COUNT_ESTIMATE(<expression>)
```

## Parameters

{: .no_toc}

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                    | Supported input types |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `<expression>` | An HLL++ sketch produced by the [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](../aggregation/hll-count-build.md) function. | `BYTEA`               |

## Return Type

`BIGINT`

## Example

{: .no_toc}

Following the [example](../aggregation/hll-count-build.md#example) in [HLL_COUNT_BUILD](../aggregation/hll-count-build.md):

```sql
SELECT hll_count_estimate(a) AS hll_estimate
FROM sketch_of_data_to_count
ORDER BY 1;
```

FROM sketch_of_data_to_count;
```
