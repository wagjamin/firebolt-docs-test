# REPLACE

Replaces all occurrences of the `<pattern>` substring within the `<expression>` with the `<replacement>` substring.

## Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
REPLACE (<expression>, <pattern, <replacement>)
```
## Parameters 
{: .no_toc}

| Parameter       | Description    | Supported input types | 
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :---------|
| `<expression>`      | The original string that will be searched for instances of the `<pattern>`. | `TEXT` |
| `<pattern>`     | The substring to be searched and replaced in the string.  | `TEXT` | 
| `<replacement>` | The substring to replace the original substring defined by `<pattern>`. To remove the `<pattern>` substring with no replacement, you can use a empty string `''` as the replacement value. | `TEXT` | 

## Example
{: .no_toc}

In the example below, "two" in "Level two" is replaced with "three".

```sql
SELECT
	REPLACE('Level two','two','three') AS level; 
```

**Returns**: `Level three`

In this example below, "eight" is replaced by an empty string.

```sql
SELECT
	REPLACE('Level eight',' eight','') AS level;
```

**Returns**: `Level`

In this following example, the substring "five" is not found in the original string, so the string is returned unchanged.

```sql
SELECT
	REPLACE('Level four','five','six') AS level;
```

**Returns**: `Level four`
