#### Fully-managed editions
 There are three editions available: **Standard**, **Enterprise**, and **Dedicated**. 

<br/>
<img src="/assets/images/firebolt-fully-managed.png" width="800" alt="Firebolt offers the Standard, Enterprise, and Dedicated editions with different features."/>

**Standard edition**       
The **Standard** edition is best for teams seeking a low-cost entry point without the need to manage compute infrastructure. It offers high performance with sub-second query latency, flexible compute scaling within a single cluster. Security features include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and audit logging. **Standard** includes a flexible compute option that is optimized for either storage or for compute. Firebolt manages your compute infrastructure, software maintenance, and upgrades.

**Enterprise edition**              
The **Enterprise** edition is designed for organizations that need advanced security, compliance, and automatic compute scaling. It includes all the features in the **Standard** edition, plus multi-cluster scaling, auto-scaling for concurrency, [AWS PrivateLink](/Guides/security/privatelink), and HIPAA compliance support.

**Dedicated edition**               
The **Dedicated** edition is ideal for organizations that require high levels of security and isolation, such as those operating in government clouds. It includes all the features in the **Enterprise** edition, plus complete data isolation on a single-tenant infrastructure, offering the highest level of security.


### Fully-managed pricing model

The total cost for Fireboltâ€™s fully-managed editions consists of a **cost for data storage** plus a **cost for compute usage**. The compute usage cost depends on the type of engine that you select: compute-optimized or storage-optimized.

<br/>
<img src="/assets/images/compute-usage-cost.png" width="700" alt="Total cost consists of data storage and compute usage with two types of compute options."/>

#### Data storage pricing
Data storage costs are based on the amount of compressed data stored, including indexes and raw data. Pricing is based on Amazon S3 costs in your selected AWS region. There are no additional storage charges beyond S3 costs.

| Available AWS Regions           | Price per TB/month ($USD)     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| US East (N. Virginia)           | $23.00                        |
| US West (Oregon)                | $23.00                        |
| Europe (Frankfurt)              | $24.50                        |
| Europe (Ireland)                | $23.00                        |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore)        | $25.00                        |

#### Compute usage pricing
Compute costs are measured in Firebolt Units (FBUs) and vary based on [engine](/Overview/engine-fundamentals) node type, number of nodes or cluster size, the number of clusters and usage duration. Costs are only billed for the time Firebolt engines are running. Firebolt offers two compute family options:

* **Storage-optimized** (default): High SSD capacity for caching and production workloads.
* **Compute-optimized**: About 2x cheaper; ideal for development and test environments or workloads with smaller active datasets.

The following table outlines the available node types, their compute family, and the corresponding FBU sizing:

| Node type        | Compute family    | Sizing in FBU    |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Small (S)        | Storage-optimized | 8                |
| Medium (M)       | Storage-optimized | 16               |
| Large (L)        | Storage-optimized | 32               |
| Extra Large (XL) | Storage-optimized | 64               |
| Small (S)        | Compute-optimized | 4                |
| Medium (M)       | Compute-optimized | 8                |
| Large (L)        | Compute-optimized | 16               |
| Extra Large (XL) | Compute-optimized | 32               |

Firebolt's compute usage pricing is based on **FBUs**, which vary by node type and region. The following table provides hourly pricing for **storage-optimized** node types across **Standard** and **Enterprise** plans, distinguishing between **US and Non-US regions**. Compute costs are only incurred while Firebolt engines are running, with **per-second billing**.

### Fully-managed pricing plans
Firebolt offers two pricing options for the **Standard** and **Enterprise** editions:
* **Pay-as-you-go**: A flexible plan that provides on-demand pricing with no upfront cost or commitment. This plan is ideal for startups or teams with unpredictable workloads. Customers get billed monthly based on actual usage and only pay for what they use with per-second billing.

* **Committed-use discounts**: A consumption model that provides discounted rates against a prepaid usage commitment. This plan is ideal for organizations with consistent, high-volume workloads and results in lower total costs compared to the pay-as-you-go plan. Once all prepaid FBU credits are consumed, your plan switches to the pay-as-you-go pricing model. Customers can always continue using Firebolt, with consumption either drawing from prepaid credits or transitioning to the pay-as-you-go model when credits run out.

Contact [support@firebolt.io](mailto:support@firebolt.io) to discuss a committed-use plan, annual pricing commitments, or **Dedicated** edition pricing.
