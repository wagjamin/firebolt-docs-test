Role management in Firebolt allows you to control access to resources within your data warehouse by assigning specific privileges to users and roles. Firebolt supports two types of roles: [system roles](/Security/Role-Based Access Control/role-management/system-roles) and [custom roles](/Security/Role-Based Access Control/role-management/custom-roles). 

<Note>
Privileges can be granted to custom roles either by the [account_admin](/Overview/organizations-accounts#account-administrative-role) or the [resource owner](/Security/Role-Based Access Control/ownership).
