Querying data in Firebolt is designed to be fast, flexible, and efficient, allowing you to extract insights from large datasets. Firebolt supports interactive querying through the **Develop Workspace** for hands-on exploration and offers an API for programmatic access, making it easy to integrate queries into automated workflows. 

Firebolt provides the following approaches for querying data: 

* The [Develop Workspace](/query-data/using-the-develop-workspace) &ndash; An intuitive, web-based user interface for writing, running, and refining SQL queries. It simplifies the query development process with features like syntax highlighting, instant query results, and result visualization. Designed for interactive exploration and analysis, the **Develop Workspace** can help you work efficiently with large datasets, troubleshoot queries, and fine-tune performance in a single integrated environment.
* [Drivers](/developing-with-firebolt) &ndash; Libraries and SDKs that enable you to connect to Firebolt databases from your applications, scripts, and tools. Firebolt provides drivers for popular programming languages like Python, .NET, and Java, allowing you to interact with Firebolt databases programmatically and integrate them into your applications.
* [Connectors](/integrations/integrations) &ndash; Pre-built integrations that enable you to connect Firebolt to third-party tools, data sources, and services. Firebolt offers connectors for popular data tools like Tableau, Looker, and dbt, allowing you to seamlessly query Firebolt databases from your preferred analytics platforms.
* The [Firebolt API](/query-data/using-the-api) &ndash; A REST API that provides access to Firebolt databases. Allows you to create a custom integration with Firebolt, in case none of the available drivers or connectors meet your requirements.
