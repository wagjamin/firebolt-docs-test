In Firebolt, an **organization** can have multiple **accounts**, each serving as a separate workspace for managing resources and data. Within each account, users are created to control access, with their identities defined through logins or service accounts. **Logins** are associated with individual human users, each authenticated by unique credentials, allowing them to interact directly with Firebolt's resources according to assigned roles. **Service accounts** provide programmatic access for applications and automated processes within the account, such as data pipelines or monitoring tools. Each login and service account is linked to specific **roles**, which define their permissions, ensuring that access is managed efficiently and securely across the organization.

## <img src="/assets/images/icon-login.png" alt="Icon for a Firebolt login for human access." width="30"/> Logins

A **login** in Firebolt represents a **human user** and is associated with an individual’s credentials, identified by an **email address**. Logins are tied to user roles, which define what the individual can access or modify. A login is primarily used for human authentication and allows a user to access the platform, run queries, and interact with databases and other resources. For instance, a login object might be created for a specific person such as `kate@acme.com`, and this login is linked to roles that control permissions.

## <img src="/assets/images/icon-service-account.png" alt="Icon for a Firebolt service account for programmatic access." width="30"/> Service accounts

A **service account** represents a **machine or application** rather than a human user. It allows automated processes to authenticate and interact with Firebolt resources. A service account is used for programmatic access, such as in pipelines, monitoring systems, application data access, and scheduled queries. Service accounts are associated with roles just like logins but are designed to operate without human intervention. For example, a service account might be used for a data pipeline that regularly ingests data into Firebolt. Each service account must be associated with a user. For more information about how to create and manage service accounts, see [Manage programmatic access to Firebolt](/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts).

## <img src="/assets/images/icon-user-bangs.png" alt="Icon for a Firebolt user." width="30"/> Users

 A **user** is a distinct identity that interacts with the Firebolt platform. Each user is assigned specific **roles**, which determine what actions they can perform and which resources they can access. Users are essential for controlling access in Firebolt and are managed through **role-based access control (RBAC)**. Users authenticate via **logins** or **service accounts**, depending on whether they are human users or machine-based processes.

 A user must be associated with **either** a login or a service account, as follows:

<img src="/assets/images/user_login_service-account.png" alt="A user must be associated with either a login or a service account." width="500"/>


There can be multiple users per login or service account. Users are managed at the account level, as shown in the following diagram:

<img src="/assets/images/multiple-users-per-login-or-sa.png" alt="There can be multiple users per login, for human access, or per service account, for programmatic access" width="500"/>

You can [add](/managing-your-organization#set-up-a-new-user), [edit](/managing-your-organization#edit-an-existing-user) or [delete](/managing-your-organization#deleting-an-existing-user) users using SQL in the **Develop Space** or using the user interface (UI) in the **Configure Space**.

<Note>
Managing roles requires the account_admin role. For more information about roles, see the [Roles](/Overview/organizations-accounts#roles) section in [Organizations and accounts](/Overview/organizations-accounts), and the [Account permissions](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/account-permissions)  section of [Role-based access control](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control) that specifies permissions for **CREATE USER**.

## Set up a new user

To set up a new user, complete the following steps:

1.  Create a new login or service account. The following section provides information about creating a new login, for human access to Firebolt. If you want to set up a new user for programmatic access, see [Create a service account](/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts#create-a-service-account).
2. Create a new user.
3. Link the user with a login or a service account.
4. Create a role.
5. Assign the role to the user.

The following sections guide you through the previous steps.

### Set up a new user for programmatic access

<img src="/assets/images/workflow-new-user-sa.png" alt="To set up a new user for programmatic access, first set up a service account." width="700"/>

To set up a user for programmatic access, [create a service account](/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts#create-a-service-account), and then complete the steps in the following sections to [create a user](/managing-your-organization#create-a-user), [link the user](/managing-your-organization#link-the-user-to-the-login-or-service-account) to a service account, [create a role](/managing-your-organization#create-a-role), and [assign the role](/managing-your-organization#assign-a-role-to-a-user) to the user.

### Set up a new user for human access

#### Create a login
<img src="/assets/images/workflow-new-user-create-login.png" alt="To set up a user for human access, first create a login." width="700"/>

A login is an **email** that is used for authentication. A login can be associated with multiple accounts. When you set up a new user, you must create either a login or service account for them. Create a login if you want to associate a user with human access to Firebolt. [Create a service account](/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts#create-a-service-account) for programmatic access. You will link the user to **either** a login or a service account.

##### Create a login using the UI

Login to [Firebolt’s Workspace](https://go.firebolt.io/login). If you haven’t yet registered with Firebolt, see the [Get Started](/Guides/getting-started) guide. If you encounter any issues, reach out to [support@firebolt.io](mailto:support@firebolt.io) for help. Then, do the following:

1. Select the Configure icon (<img src="/assets/images/configure-icon.png" alt="The Firebolt Configure Space icon." width="12"/>) in the left navigation pane to open the **Configure Space**.
2. Select **Logins**.
3. Select **Create Login**.
4. In the **Create login** window that pops up, enter the following:
  
    1. First Name - The first name of the user.
    2. Last Name - The last name of the user.
    3. Login Name - The email address of the user.

5. Select a network policy from the drop-down list. You can choose **Default** or create your own. The default network policy accepts traffic from any IP address. For more about network policies, including how to create a new policy, see [Manage network policies](/Guides/security/network-policies).
6. Toggle the following options on or off to select the following:

    1. Is password enabled - Toggle **on** to require authentication using a password.
    2. Is MFA enabled - Toggle **on** to require authentication using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    3. Is organization admin - Toggle **on** to grant that login permissions associated with an **Organization Admin**. A user must have organization administrative privileges to manage logins and service accounts. For more information about organization administrative privileges and other roles, see the [Roles](/Overview/organizations-accounts#roles) section in [Organizations and accounts](/Overview/organizations-accounts).

7. Select **Create**.

##### Create a login using SQL

Login to [Firebolt’s Workspace](https://go.firebolt.io/login). If you haven’t yet registered with Firebolt, see the [Get Started](/Guides/getting-started) guide. If you encounter any issues, reach out to [support@firebolt.io](mailto:support@firebolt.io) for help. Then, do the following:

1. Select the **Develop** icon (<img src="/assets/images/develop-icon.png" alt="The Firebolt Develop Space icon" width="12"/>).

    By default, when you login to **Firebolt’s Workspace** for the first time, Firebolt creates a tab in the **Develop Space** called **Script 1**. The following apply:

    * The database that **Script 1** will use is located directly below the tab name. If you want to change the database, select another database from the drop-down list.

    * An engine must be running to process the script in a selected tab. The name and status of the engine that **Script 1** uses for computation is located to the right of the current selected database. If the engine has auto-start set to `TRUE`, it will start from a stopped state. For more information about auto-start, see [Immediately Starting or Automatically Stopping an Engine](/Guides/operate-engines/working-with-engines-using-ddl#automatically-start-or-stop-an-engine). 

3. Select **system** from the drop-down arrow next to the engine name. The system engine is always running, and you can use it to create a login. You can also use an engine that you create.
4. Use the syntax in the following example code to create a login in the SQL Script Editor:

    ```sql
    CREATE LOGIN "<login_name>"
    WITH FIRST_NAME = <first_name> 
    LAST_NAME = <last_name>;
    ```

#### Create a user

<img src="/assets/images/workflow-new-user-create-user.png" alt="To set up a new user, after you create a login, create a user." width="700"/>

After you create a login, the next step is to create a user.

   2. **Assign to** - Use the dropdown to assign the user to one of the following:  
      i. **Unassigned** - No specific assignment.

      ii. **Login** - Associates the user with a login name or email address. After selecting this option, you will be prompted to choose the login name or email address.

      iii. **Service Account** - Associates the user with a service account. After selecting this option, you will be prompted to choose a service account name.
   1. **Role** - Select the role you want to assign to the user. If no role is specified, the user is automatically granted a [public role](/Overview/organizations-accounts#public-role). For more information about roles, see the [Roles](/Overview/organizations-accounts#roles) section in [Organization and accounts](/Overview/organizations-accounts).

   2. **Default Database** - Choose a database to associate with the user, setting it as their default for access.

   3. **Default Engine** - Choose a default processing engine to associate with the user.

5. Select **Create new user** to save the configuration. 


##### Create a user using SQL

Use the syntax in the following example code and the [CREATE USER](/sql_reference/commands/access-control/create-user) statement to create a user in the **SQL Script Editor** in the **Develop Space**:

```sql
CREATE USER <my_user>;
```

You can also create a user and link it to a login simultaneously as shown in the following code example:
```sql
CREATE USER <my_user> WITH LOGIN = "<my_login>";
```

Create a user and link it to a service account at the same time as shown in the following code example:

```sql
CREATE USER <my_user> WITH SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<my_service_account>
```

#### Link the user to the login or service account

<img src="/assets/images/workflow-new-user-link-login.png" alt="To set up a new user, after you create a user, link it to the login or service account." width="700"/>

If the user wasn’t associated with a login or service account when they were created, you must link them.

##### Link a user using the UI

1. Select the Govern icon (<img src="/assets/images/govern-icon.png" alt="The Firebolt Govern Space icon" width="12"/>) in the left navigation pane to open the **Govern Space**.
2. Select **Users** from the left sub-menu bar.
3. Select the three horizontal dots (…) to the right of the user that you need to link to a login.
4. Select **Edit user details**.
5. If you want to link the user to a login for human access, select **Login** from the drop-down list next to **Assign to**. If you want to link the user to a service account for programmatic access, select **Service Account** from the drop-down list next to **Assign to**.
6. If you want to link the user to a login for human access, select the name of the login to associate with the user from the drop-down list under **Login name**.  If you want to link the user to a service account for programmatic access, select a name from the drop-down list next to **Service account name**. This drop-down list contains only login accounts that are not already assigned to a user in the current account.
7. Select **Save**.

##### Link a user using SQL

Use the syntax in the following example code and the [ALTER_USER](/sql_reference/commands/access-control/alter-user) statement to link a user to a login in the **SQL Script Editor** in the **Develop Space**:

```sql
ALTER USER <my_user> SET LOGIN = "<login_name>";
```

The following code links a user to a service account:

```sql
ALTER USER <user_name> SET SERVICE_ACCOUNT = <service_account_name>
```

#### Create a role
<img src="/assets/images/workflow-new-user-create-role.png" alt="To set up a new user, after you link the user, create a role." width="700"/>

    4. **Usage any engine** - Toggle **on** to allow the user to use any engine in the account, or keep the option **off** to select the specific engine the user can use.

7. Select **Create**.

##### Create a role using SQL

Use the syntax in the following example code and the [CREATE ROLE](/sql_reference/commands/access-control/create-role) and [GRANT](/sql_reference/commands/access-control/grant) statements to create a role in the **SQL Script Editor** in the **Develop Space**:

```sql
CREATE ROLE <my_role>;
```

Use the following code to grant engine **access to a role**:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON ENGINE <engine_name> TO <role_name>
```

Use the following code example to grant a role permission to **modify a database**:

```sql
GRANT MODIFY ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <role_name>
```

Use the following code example to grant a role permission to **create objects inside the public schema**:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <role_name>
```

Use the following code to grant a role permission to **access the public schema** in a database:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO <role_name>
```

Use the following code example to grant a role permission to **read data from a specified table**:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <table_name> TO <role_name>
```

For more information about role-based access, see [Manage role-based access control](/Guides/security/rbac).
