### Firebolt Support Access
Firebolt Support Access allows you to manage and control the level of access that Firebolt's support team has to your account.

For new accounts, support access is enabled by default; however you can revoke it at any time.

All support team activity is logged and can be viewed in the [query history](/sql_reference/information-schema/engine-query-history).

To grant access to the support team:

1. Select "Firebolt Support Access"
2. A support access form will appear, with the following information populated **automatically**:

    - **Account Name**
    - **Duration**
    - **Assign Roles**

3. Fill in the following:

    - **Duration** - Specify the duration for which you'd like to grant access to the support team. Once this period ends, access will be automatically revoked.
    - **Assign Roles** - Select the role(s) that you want to assign to the support team. Their access will be limited to these roles. You can create a dedicated role by following the [instructions here](/Overview/Security/Role-Based Access Control/role-management/custom-roles). Note that the support team will have full access data at the organization level.

4. Select **Grant Access**.

Once access is granted, an additional icon will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen, indicating that Firebolt's support team has access to your account, as shown below:
